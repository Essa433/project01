# Week 1 Project

## Guidelines 
- you need to make this game in a node enviourment (node files), meaning do not use the browser for this project
- you can go as creative as possible
- make sure to check the minimum requirement, since the grading will be based on these.
- check the bouns section if you need more practice

### Project
The project for week one is to implement a simple game of hangman, 

Hangman is a game where you give the user the number of charactors and then allow the user to guess a letter, 

- Each incorrect guess will contribute to form the hanged man, once the user guess 5 times incorrectly then the hang man is completed and the user loses, 

- If the user guesses correctly you fill the word with that charactor and allow the user to guess again

- Finally if the user guesses the number twice don't progress the hangedman and just let the user know why it did not progress

and that's it

### minimum requirement
- you need to be able to play the game
- you need to have a win or a lose screen
- the input must be from the user's choice (not variables or argv arguments)

### Bouns Objectives
- have catagories to choose the word that come from (meaning you can have multiple catagories for words).
- have a set of charactors that the user can choose from (meaning make the keyboard less than 26 letters, kind of like wordle).
- allow retries on the same word, instead of randomly again.


Have fun with it :)
